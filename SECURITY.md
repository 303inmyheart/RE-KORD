# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security problems **privately**. Do not open a public issue.

- Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security › Report a vulnerability** on
  [github.com/Creiv/RE-KORD](https://github.com/Creiv/RE-KORD/security/advisories/new).
- Include the RE-KORD version, the platform, how the hub is exposed (LAN, tunnel, reverse
  proxy, Docker), steps to reproduce and the impact you expect.

We aim to acknowledge reports within a week and to agree on a disclosure date once a fix
is available. Credit is given in the release notes unless you prefer otherwise.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 5.x (RE-KORD 5, Rust / Tauri) | Yes |
| Legacy (Electron / Node, up to the legacy 5.0) | No; please upgrade |

## Security model

RE-KORD is a **personal hub for a trusted home network**. Understanding what it does and
does not protect helps you expose it safely.

### No user authentication

Accounts are profiles, not logins: there are **no passwords or PINs**. Anyone who can
reach the hub's port can browse the library, play music and use any account's personal
data (favorites, playlists, moods, settings). Protection comes from *where* the hub can be
reached and from the operation levels below.

### Network binding

- The hub listens on `0.0.0.0:7420` by default, so it is reachable from your LAN. Set
  `REKORD_BIND=127.0.0.1:7420` to restrict it to the hub computer.
- Do **not** forward port 7420 on your router. For access from outside, use the Cloudflare
  tunnel or your own HTTPS reverse proxy.

### Operation levels

Every request is classified as **local** or **remote**. A request is local only when it
comes from the loopback interface, with a loopback `Host`, without proxy headers
(`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Real-IP`, `CF-Connecting-IP`, `CF-Ray`) and
from an allowed origin. Requests through the Cloudflare tunnel or a reverse proxy are
therefore always remote, even though they reach the hub from `127.0.0.1`.

| Level | Examples | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| Personal data | Favorites, playlists, moods, queue, settings, playback | Any client |
| Library operations | Studio downloads, metadata, covers, trivia, file and folder deletion, account create/rename/delete | Local requests from any account, or any request when remote admin is on |
| Machine operations | Music folder, scans, layout, credentials (YouTube cookies, Discogs token), backup download and restore, tunnel, yt-dlp update, jobs, the remote-admin switch | The **Default** account **and** a local request, or the Default account anywhere when remote admin is on |

Refusals are `403` with `forbidden_remote` or `forbidden_default_account`.

### Machine operations

The **remote-admin switch** (admin panel, *Network › Machine operations › Also allow these
operations remotely*, or `REKORD_ALLOW_REMOTE_ADMIN=1`) lifts the local requirement. It can
only be turned on from the hub computer, and restoring a backup never turns it on.

With the switch on, anyone who reaches the hub, **including through the tunnel**, can use
the Default account to change the music folder, delete files, read backups (which contain
your credentials) and start downloads. Turn it on only on a network you trust, and
preferably not while a tunnel is running.

In Docker no request is local, so either run machine operations with
`docker exec rekord curl ... http://127.0.0.1:7420/...` or enable remote admin on a trusted
network.

### Origin policy

The hub refuses to be scripted by arbitrary web pages. Browsers may call the API only from:

- the hub's own pages (same origin, including through the tunnel);
- the RE-KORD apps (`tauri://localhost`, `http://tauri.localhost`, `https://tauri.localhost`);
- the development servers on ports 7421 and 7422 of `localhost`;
- origins listed in `REKORD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

Other origins get `403 cross_origin_forbidden` on writes and no CORS headers on reads. A
foreign page is never treated as local. Responses carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and a restrictive
`Permissions-Policy`.

### Remote access tunnel

The built-in remote access starts a **Cloudflare quick tunnel** (`cloudflared tunnel
--url http://127.0.0.1:7420`). It gets a random `https://….trycloudflare.com` address that
changes on every start.

- Because the hub has no login, **anyone who learns the address can use the hub** as a
  remote client (personal data, playback). Share it only with people you trust and stop the
  tunnel when you are done.
- Tunnel requests are remote: library and machine operations stay blocked unless remote
  admin is on.
- Traffic passes through Cloudflare's network under Cloudflare's terms.

### Files, media and external content

- Media, cover and transcode routes validate library-relative paths: no `..`, no hidden or
  reserved segments, and the resolved path must stay inside the music folder.
- Artwork downloads from metadata providers are checked against server-side request
  forgery (no private or loopback addresses).
- Request bodies are size-limited (2 MiB by default, 512 MiB for restores).
- Bundled third-party tools (yt-dlp, cloudflared, ffmpeg) are pinned and verified against
  SHA-256 hashes in `scripts/third-party.sha256`; yt-dlp self-updates are verified against
  the release's checksums.

### Data at rest

The hub stores its database, settings and credentials (Discogs token, YouTube cookies) in
its data folder in plain form; protect it with file permissions (the systemd unit runs as a
dedicated `rekord` user). **Backup ZIPs contain those credentials**: keep them private.

### Hardening checklist

- Keep the hub on a trusted LAN, or bind it to `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse proxy that adds
  authentication.
- Leave remote admin off unless you need it.
- Run the tunnel only when needed.
- Use the systemd package (dedicated user, read-only system) or the Docker image (non-root).
- Keep RE-KORD and yt-dlp up to date.
